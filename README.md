# SW5E-App
The last character builder I was building was SUPER disorganized, so I will be starting this new project with organization in mind

### Things Completed
- See Repo Character Builder V2 (I kinda fucked that one up. It's super messy, but it was a good start)

### To-Do
- Try not to fuck this one up so much that I need to start a whole new Repo
- Create Proper Organization Folders
- Begin building the base app which is the character builder
- Begin creating the JSON Files needed to create a character
  - Focus on only level 1 options for classes to make it easy

### Known issues to fix
- There is a weird issue where once I launch the app it highlights all of the welcome text... not sure what that is about
